        <h4>Once you walk in the front door, you will see a stair case immediately in front of you. Walk up those stairs, but do not go in the doors at the top of the stairs. You will see a second set of steps heading down to your left. Go down those stairs to get to the basement of Creese. Our room for practice changes occasionally, but we are almost always in a room on the right portion of the basement.</h4>
        <h2>About Our Events</h2>
        <h4><ul><li>Thursday practice is free, and you may come and go as you please. However, we occasionally hold a small practice bracket, so if you would like to be a part of those then you should show up at 6:00 when practice starts.</li>
          <li>Our Saturday bi-weekly tournaments are $5 to enter the venue and spectate, and $5 to enter into the tournament.
            <li>The $5 venue fee can be waived if you bring a Switch with a dock, all the cables for the dock, and a GameCube adapter.</li>
          </li>
          <li>If you would like to watch our tournaments without attending them, then we have a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/Drexel_gaming">Twitch Channel</a> where we stream to.</li>
