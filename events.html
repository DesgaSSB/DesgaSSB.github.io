					<p>We hold weekly practices every Thursday in the basement of Creese Student Center from 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM. Every other week we will hold a free practice bracket, so if you would like to enter that
						then it is recommended that you get there when the practice starts at 6:00 PM. You do not have to bring a setup,
						but it is recommended to come prepared with a controller if you have access to one. If you don't have your own, don't worry, we have a few spares
					that we can lend out for the night, but our supply is limited, so please try to bring your own!</p>
					<p>Our Bi-Weekly tournaments are held every other Saturday in the same location as our practices. The fee is $5 to enter the venue, and $5 to enter either singles or
						doubles bracket (you can enter both for $10). If you bring your own setup; a Switch with ALL DLC on it, a dock, all the cables, and a GameCube adapter - then we will
						waive the $5 venue fee. If you do plan to bring your own setup, please be at Creese Student Center at 2:30 so that we can help you set it up before singles starts.
						Doubles usually starts at 12:00 PM, and Singles starts around 3:00 PM.

							<p>Once you walk in the front door, you will see a stair case immediately in front of you. Walk up those stairs,
								but do not go in the doors at the top of the stairs. You will see a second set of steps heading down to your left.
								Go down those stairs to get to the basement of Creese. Our room for practice changes occasionally, but we are almost always in a room on the right portion of the basement.</p>
